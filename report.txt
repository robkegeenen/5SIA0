Exercise 1

total cycles:     896146
stalled cycles:       8000
active cycles (id_abu):      84012, utilization:          9 percent
active cycles (imm):     156099, utilization:         17 percent
active cycles (id_lsu):     174044, utilization:         19 percent
active cycles (id_mul):      42000, utilization:          4 percent
active cycles (id_alu):     336053, utilization:         37 percent
active cycles (id_rf):     754118, utilization:         84 percent


The register file is so active because each and every intermediate
results is stored in the register file.






Exercise 2

total cycles:     854146
stalled cycles:       8000
active cycles (id_abu):      84012, utilization:          9 percent
active cycles (imm):     156099, utilization:         18 percent
active cycles (id_lsu):     174044, utilization:         20 percent
active cycles (id_mul):      42000, utilization:          4 percent
active cycles (id_alu):     336053, utilization:         39 percent
active cycles (id_rf):     712118, utilization:         84 percent


Number of cycles reduced: 896146-854146=42000



Exercise 3

The ALU sees a higher utilization, because it does not have to wait
for the register file as much. The RF has the same utilization,
because each loop it is used for two cycles less, but those cycles are
also removed from the program, so the utilization stays the same. The
MUL has the same utilization also, not sure why, probably because it
still needs to wait for the ALU.


Exercise 4

Ok. Doei.
